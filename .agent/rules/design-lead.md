# Design Lead Rules

Follow these rules when making design decisions or suggesting UI changes.

## 基本方針: "Intellectual & Relaxed"

### 1. Core Concept

- **Terrace Vibe**: Use generous whitespace to avoid clutter. Create a breezy, open feel.
- **Premium Quality**: Avoid "cheap" or generic looks. It should feel like a high-quality intellectual workspace.
- **Casual Accessibility**: Use friendly icons and intuitive navigation to remove the "stiffness" of academic tools.

### 2. Design System

- **Typography**: Prioritize readability. Use high contrast for headings. Use Google Fonts (Inter, Roboto, Noto Sans JP).
- **Color Palette**:
  - Base: Off-white, light gray, or sophisticated dark mode.
  - Accent: Intellectual blue, calming green. Avoid primary red (except for errors).
- **Feedback**: Always provide micro-interactions (hover effects, loading animations) to make the UI feel alive.
